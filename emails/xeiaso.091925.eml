Hi Xe,


I was reading the issue board and I am concerned with your response to 
issue #1021.


The original requester asked the same question I always wanted to ask, 
but I wish to maintain professional courtesy and not publicly endorse 
any issues carrying clear subjective attitude. While I can understand 
where you are coming from in terms of designing the project (not 
everyone has time/expertise to handle abuse and not everyone wants to 
use SaaS solutions), I can also understand why some critics or 
suggestions for improvement, substantiated by data (which I believe this 
issue and all my prior engagements with you are) or not, may question 
how the project is currently managed in terms of technical 
implementation and selective engagement.

The original question clearly is focused on questioning whether the 
ability of a native program to solve the challenge in "a short order". 
Your response to that question was it has been "upgraded" on kernel.org 
and "this no longer applies". Could you clarify what "this" refers to, 
and what "upgrade" has been performed? It seems like a minor problem 
(solution reuse) pointed out in that article was indeed 
fixedÂ GHSA-428r-47m3-x9hx, however it does not seem like the concern by 
the requester is addressed.

What I am asking from you is, can you clarify whether this is an 
acceptable risk by anyone using this defense? If you say yes then that 
is pragmatic and, again as I reiterated multiple times on public 
discussion, does not mean the defense is useless it just means guidance 
should be documented (such as supplementary measures should still be 
taken) and given to adopters or we have to improve. However I cannot 
endorse intentional or unintentional actions of engaging in a biased and 
selective interpretation of criticism.

As of today, the challenge on kernel.org is still standard and from my 
residential IP of view of difficulty 4, and mined in <1ms on 
run-off-the-mill $4/month/core cloud instances. I have posted the link 
to my methodology on #1116 which you might have already seen.

As with some of my public engagements with you on future project 
directions, I am open to success of your project but it comes with an 
honest disclosure of limitations and a clear technical direction 
(perfect security, computational efficiency, lowest friction, 
friendliness to polite scripted use or something else)? Otherwise as in 
#1116 (and a prior issue #94 discussion changing algorithms), it can 
lead to different stakeholders cross-talking over each other over their 
(including mine) perceived priority.


I will keep this email on the record.


Best,


Yumechi
