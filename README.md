A fast, data-parallel, adversarially [^3] implemented mCaptcha/Anubis/Cerberus/go-away/Cap.js PoW solver, targeting AVX-512/SHA-NI/simd128. Can be used for computing solutions to these systems without disabling privacy-enhancing features, without wasting energy in the browser.

[^3]: Adversarial refers to challenges are solved using the path-of-least-resistance, sometimes involving massaging nonce space into favorable conditions or partially inverting hash images into lower-latency internal states. Most schemes supported do not have explicit specifications and depend on the cryptographic guarantees of the hash function, which I did not break (at least not in a previously unknown way). This code follows the original code to the letter of the law and sometimes emit awkward but computationally or statistically favorable solutions (such as `10000000073377131`, `-10.00000141128212`, etc.)

The benchmarks demonstrate a significant performance gap between browser-based JavaScript execution and native implementations, suggesting fundamental challenges for PoW-based browser CAPTCHA systems.

## Upstream Response 

We had opened some issues to upstream when there are clear performance regressions (i.e. not just optimization by a factor but non-linear server-side performance degradation). Here are the current statuses:

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| mCaptcha   | [#186](https://github.com/mCaptcha/mCaptcha/issues/186)                    | Difficulty inversion; Spin loop, stalls at ~200 rps                  | **Pending Since 06/05/2025**                  |
| Anubis     | [#1103](https://github.com/TecharoHQ/anubis/issues/1103)                   | Lock-convoy on certain backend caps at 5-6 k rps                     | **Fixed** (pending algo tweak)                |

| Cap.js     | [#97](https://github.com/tiagozip/cap/issues/97)                           | Difficulty inversion; Event-loop starvation, drops from 400 → 50 rps | **Declined** ("out-of-scope"/suggested IP RL) |
| GoToSocial | [PR 4433](https://codeberg.org/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial/pulls/4433) | Structural bias                                                      | **Feature removed**                           |

All load tests were performed using the `live` command with the following methodology:

- For projects with multiple difficulty presets, the highest difficulty preset was used
- All requests are strictly proof of work round-trips and contain valid proof of work. No backend service were hooked up.
- Supplementary features that are irrelevant to this study such as traditional IP rate-limiting were disabled.
- These tests were performed on a 32-core AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, actual ratio/capacity may vary depending on server capacity and topology.
- "difficulty inversion" was defined as a the server not being able to fully load all 32-cores at at least 1:1 latency (as reported by `http_wait` metric at cutoff 50%) or 1:1 CPU usage to `pow-buster`'s throughput.

## Features

- SHA-2 and BLAKE3 hotstarting with round-level precomputation granularity
- Structure of Array hashing backed by register-resident SIMD.
- 3 searching modes: Prefix greater than (mCaptcha), prefix less than (Anubis/go-away), mask test (Cerberus/Cap.js)
- Greedy padding logic with 64-bit integer and floating point nonce stretching
- Efficient outer loop and SIMD nonce encoding
- Fully unrolled and monomorphic core friendly to pipelining and ternary logic instruction lowering
- Short-circuiting comparison with $H_1 \to H_7$ feed-forward elision with optional 64-bit support
- Switch to octal nonces when success rate is overwhelming
- An API compatible with [anubis_offload](https://github.com/DavidBuchanan314/anubis_offload/) but doesn't need a GPU to run.

## Building

MSRV: Rust 1.89+.

Requires AVX-512 (cpuid: `avx512f`) or SHA-NI+SSE4.1 (cpuid: `sha`, `sse4_1`) CPU or SIMD128 on WASM. If you don't have any of these advanced instruction support, sorry, some "solutions" have "changed the way" of "security" (by paying with energy and battery life and making browsing on budget hardware hard). There is a pure Rust scalar fallback that should make the code compile and work regardless.

Recommended CPU feature flags in order of preference (Tagged releases will have Linux musl builds):

- `-Ctarget-cpu=native`
- `-Ctarget-feature=+avx512vbmi` (Artifacts released on top of x86-64-v4)
- `-Ctarget-feature=+avx512f` (Artifacts released on top of x86-64-v3)
- `-Ctarget-feature=+sha,+avx2` (Artifacts released on top of x86-64-v2)
- `-Ctarget-feature=+avx2` (only BLAKE3 will be accelerated!)
- `-Ctarget-feature=+sha,+sse4_1` (only SHA-2 will be accelerated!)

```sh
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" cargo build --release --features cli
```

Optional Features:

- `compare-64bit`: Compare 64-bit words instead of 32-bit words at ~5% penalty, almost never needed for realistic challenges. Not compatible with WASM.
- `client`: End-to-end solver client, required for most non-computational functionality.
- `live-throughput-test`: End-to-end multi-worker throughput benchmark.
- `server`: Solver-as-a-Service API. It is recommended to also use `--profile release-unwinding` instead of `--release` to prevent unexpected panics from aborting the server.
- `server-wasm`: Solver-as-a-Service API (with WASM simd128 solver, build first with `./build_wasm.sh`).

```

### Building the browser extension (experimental)

The browser extension bundles a SIMD128 WASM solver for Anubis and Cerberus that is much more performant and energy-efficient than vendor-provided solvers and optionally can be configured to fetch solutions from a remote `pow-buster` server.

```sh
> ./build_wasm.sh
> cd browser-addon && web-ext build
```

Browser addons will be released _unsigned_. To install it you have to: 

- get it signed under your developer account, or
- On any Firefox browser that is not the release flavor (e.g. Nightly, LibreWolf, etc.), manually flip `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config` to install them.

For easier to use (but less reliable) alternatives, I highly recommend trying out the [NoPoW](https://git.gay/49016/NoPoW) extension (which is signed by Mozilla because it is just a UA changer) which simply exploits over-fit heuristics in the vendor code and would suffice for most websites except the most paranoid ones that indiscriminately PoW every visitor.

## Limitations

We assume you have a relatively modern and powerful platform, specifically:

- A cold optimized build with end-to-end features may take up to 5 minutes as this program aggressively generates specialized kernels and build time isn't my priority.
- For Anubis target, this assumes the server is 64-bit (i.e. is able to accept a signed 64-bit nonce).
- AVX-512 build requires Rust 1.89 or later.
- All solvers are single-threaded and are intended to be scaled up using multiple workers optionally pinned to specific cores.
- This is designed for "low", practical-for-a-website difficulty settings, A worst-case $1 - P_{geom}(80e7, 1/\text{difficulty})$ chance of failure for any particular messaeg offset with most offset cases almost guaranteed to succeed eventually, which for 1e8 (takes about 10 seconds on a browser for mCaptcha and an eternity for Anubis) is about 0.03%. Go-away solver explores the full solution space and guarantees a solution if one exists.

## Ethical Disclaimer (i.e. the "How Dare you Publish this?" question)

This isn't a vulnerability nor anything previously unknown, it's a structural weakness that needs to be assessed. I didn't "skip" or somehow "simplify" any number of SHA-2 rounds, it is a materialized analysis of performance characteristics of the system.

This is a structural limitation, PoW is supposed for global consensus, not maintaining a meaningful peer-to-peer "fair" hash rate margin, especially not when compared to commodity hardware. Every academic paper will tell you that PoW system loses protection margin using hardware or software optimizations. I implemented it, that's it.
 
Website operators deploying a PoW system bear the responsibility to understand the performance characteristics and security implications of their chosen PoW parameters, and whether that protects against their identified threat. __The purpose of this research is to provide the statistical analysis and empirical validation data necessary for informed deployment decisions, including optimized CPU only solutions.__ 

## Benchmark

Most of the formal comparison is done against mCaptcha, because they have a WASM solver and cannot be immediately dismissed as "that's JS overhead"/"we will do better later".

TLDR; My extrapolated throughput for each approach, corroborated by empirical and formal benchmarks:

![Extrapolated throughput](plots/time.png)

### Formal Benchmark (mCaptcha only)

Speedup against official solution, reported by Criterion.rs, single-threaded except for "mCaptcha User Survey extrapolated" column which uses all worker threads on the user's browser:

Results on AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, 32 hyperthreads, when supported, single-hash number comes first (there is 90% chance your deployment is single-hash, this vagueness is IMO design oversight by the mCaptcha team), double-hash number comes second, all numbers are in milliseconds, compiled with `-Ctarget-cpu=native` unless otherwise specified.

All 32 hyperthreads of a AMD Ryzen 9 7950X are used for the end-to-end benchmark. It seems we are at the bottleneck of the server being able to record successful attempts, as further performance tuning only show improvement in offline benchmarks.

### Cap.js Browser Comparison

Cap.js is a good end-to-end comparison target since it:
- Uses multiple sub-goals instead of one big goal, results in a normal instead of geometric distribution of solution times
- Has an official browser benchmark performed by BrowserStack
- Has a WASM solver written in Rust

Cap.js got [the following benchmark](https://github.com/tiagozip/cap/blob/0c6f140724cfad7500d3b9f59b1387c9bd91e672/docs/guide/benchmark.md) as of 09/12/2025:

Tested with BrowserStack using the following configuration:

- **Challenge difficulty:** 4
- **Number of challenges:** 50
- **Salt/challenge size:** 32
- **Number of benchmarks:** 50

We set up a local Cap.js server, set it to the same difficulty but 5000 subgoals instead of 50.

```sh
> target/release/pow-buster cap-js --site-key 8b4574013b --url http://localhost:3000/

challenge: CapJsChallengeDescriptor { rules: CapJsChallengeRules { count: 5000, salt_length: 32, difficulty: 4 }, token: "58c59bcc0395e2ee385ed2306581d2d5720079370967838c6b" }
{
  "token": "04d15ccd0a853a79:1fa4246e098cbcf7e9d0b946a44f42",
  "expires": 1757723993381,
  "_meta": {
    "elapsed_us": 199841,
    "attempted_nonces": 326359936,
    "hashrate": 1633097992
  }
}
```

We solved it in ~200ms using 32-threads on a 7950X at 1.633 GH/s (faster because of hotstarting), and about 150x faster than MacBook Air M3. Taking out the thread count
lead (32 threads on 7950X, 8 threads on MacBook Air M3), we are at about 40x "net" speedup per thread.

### Throughput Sanity Check

Just as a sanity check to make sure we are actually performing checks with effective data parallelism and the difference is not just because implementation overhead, here are the numbers from OpenSSL with SHA-NI support:

The program were built with `-Ctarget-feature=+avx512f` and `-Ctarget-feature=+sha,+avx` respectively and ran on 7950X with mitigations enabled.

#### Single Threaded

```sh
> openssl speed sha256
type             16 bytes     64 bytes    256 bytes   1024 bytes   8192 bytes  16384 bytes
sha256          207107.04k   645724.06k  1507281.95k  2220402.22k  2655970.10k  2687872.17k
```

The single-threaded throughput for OpenSSL with SHA-NI support is about 12.94 MH/s (828.2MB/s) single block, 42.00 MH/s (2.86 GB/s) continuous.

For us we have single thread:

| Workload                         | AVX-512 [log](time.txt) | SHA-NI [log](time_sha-ni.txt) | Chromium SIMD128 [log](time_simd128.txt) |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| SingleBlock/Anubis               | 89.16 MH/s              | 62.19 MH/s                    | 14.74 MH/s                               |
| DoubleBlock (mCaptcha edge case) | 53.28 MH/s              | 42.55 MH/s                    | Not Tested                               |
| go-away (32 bytes)               | 98.42 MH/s              | 78.10 MH/s                    | Not Tested                               |
| Cerberus (BLAKE3)                | 205.98 MH/s             | N/A                           | 49.86 MH/s                               |

On a mobile CPU (i7-11370H), similar performance can be achieved on AVX-512 (at a higher IPC due to Intel having faster register rotations):

| Workload                         | AVX-512     | SHA-NI     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| SingleBlock/Anubis               | 72.30 MH/s  | 21.87 MH/s |
| DoubleBlock (mCaptcha edge case) | 44.84 MH/s  | 14.46 MH/s |
| go-away (32 bytes)               | 80.53 MH/s  | 20.42 MH/s |
| Cerberus (BLAKE3)                | 179.07 MH/s | N/A       |

The throughput on 7950X for Anubis and go-away is about 100kH/s on Chromium and about 20% of that on Firefox, this is corroborated by Anubis's own accounts in their code comments using 7950X3D empirical testing. Empirical throughput of WASM-based mCaptcha is unreliable due to lack of official benchmark tools, but should be around 2-4 MH/s, corroborated with the author's CACM paper.

#### Multi Threaded

The peak throughput on 7950X reported by `openssl speed -multi 32 sha256` is 239.76 MH/s (15.34 GB/s) single block, 1.14 GH/s (73.24 GB/s) continuous.

[^4]: Due to instablity of WASM optimization and runtime throttling behavior and lack of vendor provided benchmark harness, only approximate numbers can be provided.

On EPYC 9634 with better thermals, OpenSSL has 598.28 MH/s (38.29 GB/s) single block, 1.91 GH/s (122.54 GB/s) continuous.

## Security Implications

The performance gap between optimized native code and browser JavaScript (>100x) makes it impractical to set difficulty levels that are both:
   - High enough to prevent automated solving on native hardware
   - Low enough to be solvable in browsers within reasonable timeouts

These findings suggest that both designing and adopting a PoW-based CAPTCHA systems may need additional verification mechanisms beyond empirical testing.

## Conflict of Interest Disclosure

This work is not funded or sponsored by any external entity and entirely my own research on my own time. While I personally hold negative ethical and technical position against using Proof of Work for the open-web in general, no vendor, competitor, professional affiliation or bounty program otherwise influenced its content.

For benchmarks conducted against vendor code, I am happy to rerun and/or clarify any part of the analysis by request if any vendor believes particular performance characteristics demonstrated here no longer apply or requires further clarification. Create an issue with:

- An official release or beta-release tag that you want to be benchmarked.
- Proposed methodology (commands to build your project, environment setup, etc).

I will rerun the benchmarks and update relavant sections and keep all communications on record.

## Contributing / Wishlist

Contributions are welcome, roughly in priority order we want:

1. General profiling and further optimization.
2. Would be nice to have a WebGPU solution that can be used in a UserScript.
3. An AVX-2 solution and corresponding benchmark. (low priority as this isn't really a "product")

## AI Disclaimer

YES, this crate includes AI generated code, does it matter?

- Can _anyone_ use AI to write this particular solution? Absolutely not, you have to give it enough context or direction, which requires human intelligence.
- Is the core logic generated or conceived by an AI? Absolutely not, it can't.
- Did AI "plagiarize" this solution? Absolutely, it plagiarized the FIPS 180-4 SHA-2 IV, round constants, and test vector, and "subtly" embedded it into my code, go figure if it is important to you.

  Little challenge to "human touch"/"tool usage" enjoyers: ssshhhhh... actually the AES key of my password manager is the SHA-256 of all the bytes in the source code that is typed by my keyboard concatenated together (sort files in alphabetical order), give it a crack! $1M reward!

That is why I argue gatekeeping or who is "good at programming" based on "AI usage" is a bad idea.
