    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <p>
        Anubis/Go-away: You should find the challenge JSON in `head > script#anubis_challenge` or a network request
        that ends with `/make-challenge`. Copy the challenge JSON and paste it into the textarea below.
        Characters before the first `{` and after the last `}` are ignored.
        <br>
        Response will be a single redirect URL provided in JavaScript format mirroring the official solver's behavior
        after a solution is found.
    </p>
