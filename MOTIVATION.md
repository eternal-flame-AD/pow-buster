# Who is this for?

Consumer advocacy and improving accessibility and equal access of the open-web.

I publish high throughput solvers and host them on pre-paid clould compute online with the right price tag and necessary instruction sets to solve these challenges at scale instantly and at orders of magnitude speedup. 

If somebody floods my server I would just make what every rational operator should do: identify, attribute, gather evidence, mitigate and monitor. Not this "necessary evil" snake oil - how necessary, how evil? No one gave me a clear answer and I believe any rational person would be rightful to be suspicious.

Additionally, not all website operators have experience in performance optimization. Benchmarks and Proof of Concept here are valuable information for both informed decision making, capacity planning and security validation.

# Doesn't this enable more abuse?

Sure if some "believers" that arbitrary economical leverage can be just "fixed" by Proof of Work like to look it that way, that's their logical leap of higher RPS means higher abuse (just like many "believers" like to use lower RPS as "proof" the system is beneficial) I never claimed. 

If vendors and "believers" are allowed to make value judgements without quantitative proof of benefits, my tool is not in anyway less "necessary evil" than their own. It is a "you believe, I believe" problem that I am winning on performance metrics and technical execution and epistemic transparency grounds. 

At least I acknowledge my solvers work well only with AVX512, and I pay out of pocket to host solvers anyone can get solutions for free with no questions asked, knowing it will be OOM cheaper than any device you just browse web pages with. instead of making it about a tech-bro warfare of escalating security requirements and debating what is the "best" way for bystanders on the Internet to burn more CPU cycles, what have the vendors done?

## But, non-standard search-orders are "vulnerabilities" that should be embargoed

I want accessibility and in the meantime minimize my side of the cost so I optimize aggressively with adversarial techniques that the designers failed to mitigate, perfectly reasonable actions by any web service provider. Whether it violated the vendor's implict assumptions and engagement rules or not is the vendor's engineering and transparency deficiency (lack of SLO and vulnerability scope, lack of documented security assumptions, lack of public peer review channels, etc) not my responsibility.

ISO/IEC 29147:2018: â€œCoordinated vulnerability disclosure does not apply when no confidentiality, integrity or availability impact exists." There is nothing here that isn't already a well-known fact to the public: Providing concrete benchmark numbers using industry standard optimization techniques does not constitute a vulnerability discovery. PoW is designed to be optimized and not to be "equitable". The only question is whether the optimization undermines the system's practical purpose, which is not relavant to confidentiality, integrity or availability.
 
Any "cryptanalytic" techniques used are also well-known miner tricks publicly documented, and not a "vulnerability" simply because the vendor did not take actions to identify and mitigate them.

# What should be done?

I have a very simple and low bar for the vendor: be honest and be epistemic. Know what you don't know, if you don't have RUM then don't claim user-centric benefits. If you can't have RUM because of "privacy", I don't care, that is your design constraint that you should figure out before speculating benefits out of N/A values, or at least disclose you do not have evidence before shipping the solution or making self-serving logicals leaps based on speculating benefits of accessibility, latency or abuse deterrence based on what is arguably not supported from missing data. 

Unsubstantiated claims commonly made by some vendors and "believers" include but are not limited to: 

- Having a large chunk of user - often those from disadvantaged geographic regions or running obsolete systems solve a hard "puzzle" is better than a service "under attack" / being "offline". For those who claim Proof of Work is "necessary evil", where is the FCP and TBT metric? Count your challenge solving time as "dead weight", not contentful and blocking user, and show the overall metric still improved or it is not supported by data.
- A significant increase in compute cycles required for automated abuse translate to a significant increase in OpEx for abuse overall when counted for other cost leaders such as bandwidth, proxies and legal costs. Show a realistic cost breakdown for an abuse scenario and what the cost would be for an alternative or null intervention, or it is not supported by data.
- Proof of Work is a "proven" way to help with economical leverage - The only "proven" use is cryptocurrency and no one can gain an aggregate 51% of hash rate when the incentives are equal (profit from mining). None of the assumptions apply in web services: They are not proven to be equitable between users with different economic conditions nor is it proven to be equitable between causual visitors who just want content anytime on any device and determined scrapers or attackers with dedicated research personnel and significant financial incentive.
- Proof of Work "solve" a problem that is "hard" - Defined the "problem" clearly with goals, constraints and success metrics well enough to distinguish a "working" solution and a "non-working" solution. Show your solution satisfied the success criteria, and is there evidence that other techniques would not have worked with comparable or lower complexity and cost?
- The compute puzzle is "accessible": If you are on a powerful computer and you never have a loved one struggling economically or have a "bad reputation" User-Agent/fingerprint/ASN/IP just because they come from a country with developing economy or oppressive censorship, don't claim your system is going to improve accessibility and availability. 

The entire premise of such forced-upon "Proof of Work" is ethically debated in well documented professional communications, they are like chemotherapy and not something to "just deploy" because of novelty or wishful thinking based on theoretical ideal computing cost.
